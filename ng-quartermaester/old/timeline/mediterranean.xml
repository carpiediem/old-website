  <event start='3200 BC' title="Writing first used in Mesopotamia ">
    In approximately 8000 BC, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing#Mesopotamia">Mesopotamians</a> began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing the tokens in large, hollow, clay containers (bulla) which were sealed; the quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces.
